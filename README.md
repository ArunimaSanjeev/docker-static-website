Dockerized Static Website – Cloud Computing Project

This project demonstrates the deployment of a static website using Docker, highlighting containerization, portability, and cloud-ready deployment workflows.
The website runs on nginx:alpine inside a Docker container and can be accessed from any machine with Docker installed. This provides hands-on experience with cloud computing practices like image building, container management, and environment-independent deployment.
